### AGGREGATION FRAMEWORK IN MONGODB

- `Definition` : Aggregation is the process of performing transformations on documents and combining them to produce computed results.

- `Pipeline Stages` : Aggregations consist of multiple pipeline stages, each performing a specific operation on the input data.

- `Benefits` :

1. Aggregating Data: Complex calculations and operations are possible.

1. Advanced Transformations: Data can be combined, reshaped, and computed for insights.

1. Efficient Processing: Aggregation handles large datasets efficiently.
