### WORKING WITH MONGOOSE :

- It's an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

- It makes MongoDB interaction more straightforward and organized.

- It provides a structured, schema-based data modeling approach.

`Why Mongoose instead of official driver?`

1. Structured Schemas : Mongoose lets you define your data structure using schemas which makes it easier to understand your database structure and work with it.

1. Validation : Mongoose provides built-in validation to ensure validity before saving it to database.

1. Relationships : MongoDB doesnâ€™t provide relations itself. So, Mongoose helps to replicate relations in MongoDB and helps us to relate schemas with each
other easily (one-toone, one-to-many, etc.)

1. Middleware : Mongoose offer running custom functions before or after certain operations which can be useful in many cases.
